There are two kinds of inference here.

## 1st model prediction process
The one with ground truth(GT) will plot the ground truth out like the picture shown below.

You can give the order to get the result.
```
bash run_GT.sh
```
It will crawl the latest data from the website and inference.

## 2rd model prediction process
The one without ground truth is for the purpose of realistic prediction.
You can give the order below to get the result.
```
bash run.sh
```
It will crawl the latest data from the website and inference.
